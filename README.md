# Beat Maker :notes:
<br/>

> Make music by tapping pads and make colorful animation while tapping :smile:. 

I built this using vanilla javascript by following a tutorial by [Dev Ed](https://youtu.be/2VJlzeEVL8A)

**Future Considerations**

* [ ] Make this into a react app
* [ ] Add more beat samples
* [ ] Record the produced beats :wink:
* [ ] Make the color balls of random sizes and move in random directions :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
